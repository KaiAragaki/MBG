Get codon probabilities shows what the probability of codons will be given a certain GC content (default provided) and then what average peptide mass would be expected.

Initially I wanted the function to pass the codon cube through a eukaryote amino acid frequency cube, but I decided against it: That process would also have taken into account the GC content of the organism used for the eukaryote amino acid frequency cube itself, not only organism in the question.
